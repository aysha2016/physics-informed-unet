# 🧠 Physics-Informed U-Net (PINN-U-Net)

This repository implements a U-Net architecture augmented with physics-based constraints for tasks like image reconstruction or enhancement. By integrating physical laws directly into the training process via a custom loss function, the model produces solutions that are both data-accurate and physically consistent.

## 📚 About Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

This implementation combines the power of U-Net architecture with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), allowing the model to learn from both data and physical constraints. This approach ensures that the model's predictions adhere to known physical laws while maintaining high accuracy in the reconstruction or enhancement tasks.
