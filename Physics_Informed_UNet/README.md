# Physics-Informed U-Net

This repository provides a basic framework for training a U-Net model augmented with physics-based loss for applications such as image reconstruction or enhancement, with a focus on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).

## Files
- `train_model.py`: Training script for the U-Net model.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions like the physics loss function.
- `config.py`: Configuration settings for the model.
- `data/sample_data.npy`: Placeholder dataset for the model (replace with actual dataset).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the training script: `python scripts/train_model.py`
